# ML Foundations

This repository contains multiple machine learning projects created for practice and learning purposes. 

Each project is designed to help understand the core concepts of machine learning, including:

- Data preprocessing
- Model building
- Model training
- Model evaluation
- Making predictions

The projects cover various real-world datasets and focus on applying different machine learning algorithms to solve classification or regression problems.

This repository serves as a hands-on resource to strengthen machine learning skills and build a solid foundation for future learning and development.
